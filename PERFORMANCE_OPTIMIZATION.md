# Performance Optimization Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented to address the cache lifetime issues identified in your website audit, which showed potential savings of 6,612 KiB.

## Implemented Optimizations

### 1. Cache Headers (.htaccess)
- **Images**: 1 year cache (31536000 seconds) with `immutable` flag
- **CSS/JS**: 1 month cache (2592000 seconds)
- **Fonts**: 1 year cache with `immutable` flag
- **PDFs**: 1 month cache
- **HTML**: 1 hour cache (allows quick updates)

### 2. Image Optimization
- Added `loading="lazy"` to all non-critical images
- Added explicit `width` and `height` attributes to prevent layout shift
- Critical images (logo) are preloaded
- All images now have proper dimensions specified

### 3. Resource Preloading
- **DNS Prefetch**: Added for external domains (FontAwesome, CDN, Google Fonts, Google Maps)
- **Preconnect**: Added for critical external resources
- **Preload**: Critical CSS and logo image are preloaded

### 4. CDN Optimization
- Added `integrity` attributes to Bootstrap CSS/JS for security
- Added `defer` attribute to non-critical scripts
- Optimized external resource loading order

## Expected Performance Improvements

### Cache Savings
- **Images (6,336 KiB)**: Now cached for 1 year instead of 10 minutes
- **CSS (5 KiB)**: Now cached for 1 month instead of 10 minutes
- **Total estimated savings**: 6,612 KiB per repeat visitor

### Loading Performance
- **Lazy loading**: Images load only when needed, reducing initial page load
- **Preloading**: Critical resources load faster
- **DNS prefetch**: Faster connection to external services
- **Deferred scripts**: Non-blocking JavaScript execution

## File Changes Made

### .htaccess
- Comprehensive cache control headers
- Gzip compression enabled
- Security headers added
- ETags disabled (using Cache-Control instead)

### index.html
- Added lazy loading to all images
- Added explicit dimensions to prevent layout shift
- Added DNS prefetch and preconnect hints
- Added resource preloading
- Optimized external script loading
- Added integrity attributes for security

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
1. **Image optimization**: Consider converting images to WebP format for better compression
2. **Cache monitoring**: Monitor cache hit rates in server logs
3. **Performance testing**: Regular Lighthouse audits to track improvements

### Future Optimizations
1. **Image formats**: Convert to WebP with fallbacks
2. **Critical CSS**: Inline critical CSS for above-the-fold content
3. **Service Worker**: Implement for offline caching
4. **Image CDN**: Consider using a dedicated image CDN

## Testing the Changes

### Before/After Comparison
Run these tests to verify improvements:
1. **Lighthouse audit**: Check cache efficiency score
2. **Network tab**: Verify cache headers are applied
3. **PageSpeed Insights**: Monitor Core Web Vitals improvements

### Cache Verification
Check that these headers are present in browser dev tools:
- `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` (for images)
- `Cache-Control: public, max-age=2592000` (for CSS/JS)
- `Content-Encoding: gzip` (for compressed resources)

## Expected Results
- **First visit**: Similar loading time (resources need to be downloaded)
- **Repeat visits**: Significantly faster loading (6,612 KiB served from cache)
- **Mobile performance**: Improved due to lazy loading and reduced bandwidth usage
- **SEO benefits**: Better Core Web Vitals scores

## Troubleshooting

### If cache headers aren't working:
1. Verify `.htaccess` is in the root directory
2. Check server supports `mod_expires` and `mod_headers`
3. Test with browser dev tools Network tab

### If images aren't lazy loading:
1. Verify browser supports native lazy loading
2. Check for JavaScript errors in console
3. Ensure images have `loading="lazy"` attribute

This optimization should significantly improve your website's performance and reduce bandwidth usage for repeat visitors.
